Welcome to my coding journey! This repository is a collection of small-to-medium web development projects I've created as I learn and practice **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**.

All of these projects are based on exercises and challenges from **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)** and **[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)**. The goal is to build a solid foundation in full-stack web development through hands-on practice.

This repo contains individual projects grouped by technology or concept. Each project includes its own README (where applicable), and is self-contained with its own code, assets, and documentation.

This is a **learning-first** repository ‚Äî some code may not be production-grade, but each project helps build my understanding of a specific concept or technology.

## Technologies Covered

- **HTML5** - Structure of web pages
- **CSS3** - Styling and response design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactivity and dynamic behavior
- **Node.js** - Server-side programming and tools (coming soon)
